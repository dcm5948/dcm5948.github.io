<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Soundhouse Tapes is the debut EP by Iron Maiden, and features the first recordings by the band. Released on November 9th, 1979, it features three songs taken from the demo tape recorded at Spaceward Studios on  December 30 and 31st, 1978.</p>

<h4><i>What makes it so special</i></h4>
<p>Deciding to release the EP as a memento for fans, the group only printed 5,000 copies, 3,000 of which were sold by mail order in the first week.The EP was so successful that Rod Smallwood reports that several fans asked for copies of The Soundhouse Tapes at their local record stores, to the point where HMV and Virgin tried to order 20,000 copies each. Because of this, copies have sold for up to $2,000!</p>
