<h1>Super Awesome Vinyl Collection for Sale!</h1>
<h2>The "Why?"</h2>
<p>For the past 15 years, I've spents tons of hours crate digging for album gems for my vinyl records collection. Unfortunately, due to cash issues, I have to sell the entire thing in order to stay in school. This is my final year and I no longer qualify for any loans so my beautiful collection has to go! </p>
<p>Reasons why this collection is so special to me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The first vinyl I ever had was given to me by my grandfather, who also shares a love of music. </li>
    <li>My collection has been sourced from places all over the world, from Tokyo and Paris to a small city named Holly Springs in Mississippi!</li>
    <li>A lot of my vinyls have great stories as to how I got them, like the time my grandma got me an Aesop Rock album instead of A$AP Rocky!</li>
  </ul>
<h2>The "What"</h2>
<p>This collection is to be sold as a full collection of 548 records. This would be great for someone just getting into collecting, an owner of a vinyl records store or just someone that's an enthusiast like me. I have albums from almost all genres so you can expect to find everything from Soul, Jazz and Rock & Roll to Indies, Funk, Blues and Hip-Hop. There's even some obscure and experimental albums in there, like Lou Reed's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Machine_Music">Metal Machine Music</a>. Some of my gems include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Frank Ocean "Blond" 2016 Black Friday Edition</li>
  <li>Nirvana "Nevermind"</li>
  <li>Iron Maiden "The Soundhouse Tapes"<em>(Yup, <a href="itemdetail1.html">that one</a>!)</em></li>
  <li>Miles Davis "B***** Brew"</li></ol>
  <p><b>and MORE!</b></p>
  <h2>Price</h2>
  <p>Okay, let's talk <i>dineros</i>. I'm letting this collection of <b>Super</b> <em>Awesome</em> vinyls go for the small price of $7,500. This may seem like a lot, BUT my collection is valued at over $15,000 so really you're getting a great deal! And if that doesn't sway you, please see the image below for a representation of me currently!</p>
