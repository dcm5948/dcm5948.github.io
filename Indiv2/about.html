  <p class="about">Hi-Note Records was founded in 2012 by De'Ja Mitchell in Brooklyn, NY. After being fed up with her corporate job
    she decided to quit and follow her dream of owning a vinyl records store. Her love for vinyls began as a child when she was introduced 
    to it by her now late grandfather Dwellie "Sugar" Hill. <br>
    Hi-Note Records hosts a collection of vinyl records from all genres and years. We guarantee you'll find something you like!<br/>
